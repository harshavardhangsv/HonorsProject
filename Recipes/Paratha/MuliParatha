Prep Time: 15 minutes
Cook Time: 20 minutes
Serves: 4

Ingredients:

White Radish (Muli/Daikon) – 1 1/2 pounds, peeled and shredded
Salt – to taste
Cilantro/Coriander – 5 sprigs, finely chopped
Green Chilies – to taste, finely chopped
Carom Seeds (Ajwain) – 1/4 tsp

For the dough:

Chapati Flour – 1 1/2 cups
Salt – 1/4 tsp
Oil – 1 Tbsp
Warm Water – 1/2 cup + 2 Tbsp

Extra Flour – for dusting
Oil – for pan frying

Method:

Mix Salt and Oil with Flour and add warm Water. Knead to form semi-firm dough.
Coat dough with few drops of Oil, cover and set aside for 15 minutes.
Sprinkle shredded Radish with Salt, mix well and set aside for 5-10 minutes. The salt will pull out the water from the Radish.
Squeeze out and discard all of the water from the Radish.
Add Cilantro, Green Chilies and Carom Seeds to the Radish. Mix well.
Divide dough into approx 8 balls. Divide Radish mixture into 8 portions.
Roll out one dough ball into a small disc using dry flour to prevent sticking.
Place one portion of Radish mixture in the center of the disc.
Wrap the dough around the Radish mixture to form a ball.
Dip the ball into dry flour once again and roll out the paratha.
Shake off any excess dry flour and place the paratha on a hot skillet or tava.
When bubbles appear, flip the paratha over.
Wait approx 30 – 40 secs and spread a little oil on the top. Flip the paratha back to the other side and gently press to cook.
Spread a little oil onto this side. Continue to flip and press until the appearance of raw dough has gone.
Store paratha in a covered or insulated container until ready to serve. Repeat with remaining dough.
Serve paratha hot with pickle, yogurt or butter.
