Ingredients:

Basic Chapati/Paratha Dough – click here for the recipe
Eggs – 1 for every 2 Paratha
Tomatoes – Finely chopped (as needed, to taste)
Onions – Finely chopped (as needed, to taste)
Cilantro – Finely chopped (as needed, to taste)
Green Chilies – Finely chopped (as needed, to taste)
Salt – to taste

Any or all of the following (to taste):

Red Chili Powder
Chaat Masala
Coriander Powder
Cumin Powder

For the Cheese version, add any kind of shredded cheese (preferably one that melts). For kids, you can add only cheese to the beaten eggs.

Method:

Beat Eggs and mix all of the above ingredients (except dough) together with the beaten
eggs. Keep aside.
Roll out a golf ball size portion of dough into a 4-5 inch disc. Dip into dry flour to prevent it from sticking to the surface.
Coat a thin layer of oil on the disc and sprinkle dry flour onto it.
Fold the disc into a semi-circle, coat another thin layer of oil and sprinkle dry flour on it.
Fold the semi-circle into a triangle, dip it into dry flour and roll it out into a larger triangle.
Place triangle onto a hot tava and flip it once bubbles appear.
Wait another 20-30 seconds until it starts to puff up. With a butter knife, gently open up the top layer of the triangle to form a pocket.
Pour in approx. 1/2 egg worth of mixture into the pocket and close it.
Allow it to cook on low flame for 20-30 seconds and gently flip it without letting all of the egg mixture spill out. A little will ooze out but that’s ok.
Cook once again, pressing slightly until all of the raw egg is cooked inside.
Serve immediately or keep in an insulated container until ready to serve.
Tastes great with Ketchup or chutney.
