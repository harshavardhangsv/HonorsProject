Cook Time: 20 minutes
Serves: 4

Ingredients:

For the dough:
Chapati Flour – 1 1/2 cups
Salt – 1/4 tsp
Oil – 1 Tbsp
Dried Fenugreek Leaves (Kasoori Methi) – 1 Tbsp
Warm Water – 1/2 cup + 2 Tbsp

For the stuffing:
Paneer – 14 oz, grated
Salt – to taste
Chaat Masala – 1/2 tsp
Roasted Cumin Powder – 1/2 tsp
Red Chili Powder – to taste
Green Chilies – to taste, finely chopped
Cilantro/Coriander – 5 sprigs, finely chopped
Oil – for pan frying

Method:

Mix Flour, Salt, Oil and Fenugreek Leaves until Oil is incorporated into the dry flour.
Add warm water and form a firm dough.
Coat the dough lightly with few drops of oil, cover and set aside for 15 minutes.
To the grated Paneer, add Salt, Chaat Masala, Roasted Cumin Powder, Red Chili Powder, Green Chilies and Cilantro/Coriander. Mix well.
Divide dough and paneer mixture into 8 portions.
Using a little dry flour, roll out one dough ball into a small disc.
Place one portion of the paneer mixture on the disc and pull up sides of the disc around the paneer.
Pinch the dough at the top to seal the ball.
Flatten the stuffed dough and dip into dry flour to coat all sides.
Roll out into a larger disc – continuing to dip into dry flour to prevent sticking.
Place paratha on a hot tava/skillet and cook until bubbles start to appear on the top.
Flip the paratha over and cook for 30 secs.
Drizzle a little Oil on the paratha and spread to coat evenly.
Flip the paratha over and press gently with a spatula.
Lightly drizzle Oil on this side and spread to coat evenly.
Flip paratha over and again press gently.
Cook paratha until the appearance of raw dough is gone.
Remove paratha from the tava and place in a covered/insulated container. Continue with remaining parathas.
Serve hot with yogurt/curd, raita or pickle.
