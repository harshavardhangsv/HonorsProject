Ingredients:

For Dough:

Whole Wheat Flour - 1 1/2 cups
Salt – 1/4 tsp
Oil – 3 tsp
Water – 1/2 cup
Dry Flour in a plate – for rolling

For Filling: 

Potatoes - 2 large, boiled and peeled
Onion – 1/2 small, finely chopped
Chaat Masala – 1 tsp
Red Chili Powder – 1/4 tsp or to taste
Salt – 1/2 tsp or to taste
Cilantro - 5 sprigs, finely chopped
Spray Cooking Oil – for pan frying

Method:

Mash or grate boiled Potatoes.  Grating prevents lumps.
In a medium sized bowl, add Potatoes with remaining filling ingredients and mix well.
Keep a tava or skillet on the stove at medium to medium high.
Divide dough into equal size balls (approximately 8).
Divide Filling into equal size balls (approximately 8).
Roll out one dough ball into a 3-4 ” disk.
Place a Filling ball on the center of the disk and fold the dough around the Filling ball, completely enclosing it.  Pinch the dough ends together.
Flatten the stuffed ball and dip it into the dry flour on both sides.
Using a rolling pin, roll out the stuffed ball into a tortilla shaped disk. The paratha should not be too thin.
Place the rolled paratha on the heated skillet and cook until bubbles start to appear.
Start to roll the next paratha while one is cooking to get a process in place.  This is a great time saver.
Once bubbles appear, flip the paratha over and lightly spray it with cooking oil.
Allow this side to cook for 30 seconds and flip it over once more.  Again, lightly spray with cooking oil.
Keep flipping and cooking the paratha until the look of raw dough is gone and it looks completely cooked.  It should have light golden/brown spots.
Keep the paratha in a covered or insulated container and repeat process for remaining parathas.
Serves 4.
